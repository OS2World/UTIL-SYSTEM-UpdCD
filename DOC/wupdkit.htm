<h2>Warp Update Kit (WUK)</h2>
<body>

<p><b>What is the Warp Update Kit?</b><br>
The Warp Update Kit is a CD-ROM which will enable you to create your own updated Warp 3, Warp 4, WSeB, MCP or ACP installation CD-ROM. It contains UpdCD, the tools it needs and a lot of free components (like public fixpaks) you may use to build your updated CD-ROM. The installation script provided on the WUK CD-ROM (instos2.cmd) enables you to install (or remove) UpdCD, the utilities (like the virtual floppy disk) it uses and the components you select to integrate. It can also search your system looking for commercial (Software Choice) products which are <b>not included</b> on the WUK CD-ROM and will prepare them so UpdCD will be able to use them. If you do not like/want to make selections the installation program will provide you with default settings which should work for most of the users.

<p>Currently, the installation program is available in 5 languages (English, German, French, Russian and Hungarian). Other languages may follow. The WUK CD-ROM contains various free components for the English, German, Brazilian and Hungarian versions of OS/2. An approximate listing of the components found on the WUK CD-ROM can be downloaded <a href="wuklist.htm">here</a>.

<p>Although UpdCD works quite well for most of the people, I do not guarantee that it will work for you. I do not guarantee that the updated CD will work on your system. The purpose of the Warp Update Kit is to help people who cannot setup their computers to try UpdCD. 

<p>The Warp Update Kit (and UpdCD) runs under any version of OS/2 Warp 3 or higher with classical REXX support enabled. <b>It does not support ObjectREXX or REXX extenders.</b>

<p><b>What is the Warp Update Kit not?</b><br>
The Warp Update Kit is not an updated OS/2 installation CD-ROM. It does not contain any OS/2 installation files. Do not ask me to send you an updated OS/2 CD. I am not entitled to produce and sell OS/2!

<p><b>How to order?</b><br>
Fill in <a href="http://213.84.235.219/order/wxupdkit.htm">the order page</a> and email it to me by pressing the Order button. I will confirm your order and will ask you to pay for the Kit (see below). I will create and mail the ordered WUK within 2 working days after receiving your payment. I guarantee that I will send you the latest version of the WUK, including the latest official (stable) version of UpdCD. I guarantee that I will resend (1x) the WUK if it is damaged or lost during shipping.

<p><b>How to pay the Update Kit?</b><br>
The WUK costs 15 EUR. During the order process you can select between 3 payment methods. My preferred method is PayPal (see the button bellow). This is a very reliable paying method and it is entirely free for holders of most popular credit cards. You can also choose for bank transfer. This is a reliable paying method too, but most banks will charge you with additional 10 EUR for this (unless you are inside the EU). You may also send bank note(s) in an envelope to me if none of the previous methods are acceptable for you. My experience is that 95% of the money arrives but if it is lost, it is your problem. :-) Unfortunately, I cannot accept checks or money orders because of the high costs associated with them. :-(
